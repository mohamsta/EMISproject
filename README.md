## Mission Statement
Sometimes people can't always set up their appointments via a phone call. Due to long wait times, automated audio confirmation for most general tasks, and not being able to have information presented in a seamless, organized manner, our goal is to chagne those inconveniences from your web browser. Our EMIS web application will allows us to register you to appointments and view information when you are at your house, or even on the go.

## Goal
Create a web application for patients to manage their medical information online. This web application is usable by several stakeholders including: patients, office staff, nurses, and doctors.
 
## Expectations
- Get the sign in registering to work
- Set up appointments
- View patient info
- Get a chatbox for patients.
 
## Upcomming changes
- More detailed/secure log in
- Proper registration with confirmation emails
