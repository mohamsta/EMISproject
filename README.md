## Mission Statement
Sometimes people can't always set up their appointments via a phone call. Due to long wait lines, audio confirmation for everything, confusion, and not being able to have information layed out. Our goal is to chagne that right from your house. Our EMIS project will let us register you to appointments and view infomration when you are at your house, or even on the go.

Create a website for patients to manage their medical stuff online
